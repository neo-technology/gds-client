= The graph object

In order to utilize most the functionality in GDS, you must first project a graph into the https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/management-ops/graph-catalog-ops/[GDS Graph Catalog].
When projecting a graph with the Python client, a client-side reference to the projected graph is returned.
We call these references `Graph` objects.

Once created, the `Graph` objects can be passed as arguments to other methods in the Python client, for example for running algorithms or training machine learning models.
Additionally, the `Graph` objects have convenience methods allowing for inspection of the projected graph represented without explicitly involving the graph catalog.

== Projecting a graph object

There are several ways of projecting a graph object.
The simplest way is to do a https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/management-ops/projections/graph-project/[native projection]:

[source,python,group=graph-project]
----
# We put this simple graph in our database
gds.run_cypher(
  """
  CREATE
    (m: City {name: "Malmö"}),
    (l: City {name: "London"}),
    (s: City {name: "San Mateo"}),

    (m)-[:FLY_TO]->(l),
    (l)-[:FLY_TO]->(m),
    (l)-[:FLY_TO]->(s),
    (s)-[:FLY_TO]->(l)
  """
)

# We estimate required memory of the operation
res = gds.graph.project.estimate(
    ["City"],                   #  Node projection
    "FLY_TO",                   #  Relationship projection
    readConcurrency=4           #  Configuration parameters
)
assert res["bytesMax"] < 1e12

G, result = gds.graph.project(
    "offices",                  #  Graph name
    ["City"],                   #  Node projection
    "FLY_TO",                   #  Relationship projection
    readConcurrency=4           #  Configuration parameters
)

assert G.node_count() == result["nodeCount"]
----

where `G` is a `Graph` object, and `result` is a pandas `Series` containing metadata from the underlying procedure call.

Note that all projection syntax variants are supported by way of specifying a Python `dict` or `list` for the node and relationship projection arguments.
To specify configuration parameters corresponding to the keys of the procedure's `configuration` map, we give named keyword arguments, like for `readConcurrency=4` above.
Read more about the syntax in the https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/management-ops/projections/graph-project/#graph-project-native-syntax[GDS manual].

Similarly to Cypher there's also a corresponding `gds.graph.project.estimate` method that can be called in an analogous way.

To get a graph object that represents a graph that has already been projected into the graph catalog, one can call the client-side only `get` method and passing it a name:

[source,python,group=graph-project]
----
G = gds.graph.get("offices")
----

For users who are https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/management-ops/administration/[GDS admins], `gds.graph.get` will resolve graph names into `Graph` objects also when the provided name refers to another user's graph projection.

In addition to those aforementioned there are five more methods that create graph objects:

* `gds.graph.project.cypher` (This is the Legacy Cypher projection, see <<cypher-projection>> for the new Cypher projection)
* `gds.graph.filter`
* `gds.graph.generate`
* `gds.graph.sample.rwr`
* `gds.graph.sample.cnarw`

Their Cypher signatures map to Python in much the same way as `gds.graph.project` above.


[[cypher-projection]]
== Projecting a graph using Cypher Projection

The method `gds.graph.cypher.project` allows for projecting a graph using Cypher projection.
Cypher projection is not a dedicated procedure; rather it requires writing a Cypher query that calls the `gds.graph.project` aggregation function.

Read more about Cypher projection in the https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/management-ops/projections/graph-project-cypher-projection/[GDS manual].

The method `gds.graph.cypher.project` bridges the gap between <<getting-started-minimal-example, `gds.run_cypher`>> and having to follow with `gds.graph.get`.

=== Syntax
.Cypher projection signature
[opts="header",cols="2m,2m,1m,6", role="no-break"]
|===
| Name           | Type               |Default | Description
| query          | str                | -      | The Cypher query to be executed. Must end with `RETURN gds.graph.project(...)`.
| database       | Optional[str]      | None   | Overrides the target database. The default uses the database from the connection.
| **params       | Any                | \{\}   | The query parameters as keyword args.
|===


Unlike `gds.run_cypher` but very much like `gds.graph.project`, it returns a tuple of a `Graph` object and a pandas `Series` containing metadata from Cypher execution.

The method does not modify the Cypher query in any way, all projection configuration must be done in the query itself.
The method however verifies that the query only contains a single `RETURN gds.graph.project(...)` clause and that this clause appears at the end of the query.
This means that this method cannot be used to project a graph together with other aggregation in Cypher, nor can the result row be renamed.
If the provided query fails the validation, the fallback is to use `gds.run_cypher` together with `gds.graph.get` to achieve the same result.


[source,python,group=graph-cyhpher-project,role=nocollapse]
----
# We put this simple graph in our database
gds.run_cypher(
  """
  CREATE
    (m: City {name: "Malmö"}),
    (l: City {name: "London"}),
    (s: City {name: "San Mateo"}),

    (m)-[:FLY_TO]->(l),
    (l)-[:FLY_TO]->(m),
    (l)-[:FLY_TO]->(s),
    (s)-[:FLY_TO]->(l)
  """
)

G, result = gds.graph.cypher.project(
    """
    MATCH (n)-->(m)
    RETURN gds.graph.project($graph_name, n, m, {
        sourceNodeLabels: $label,
        targetNodeLabels: $label,
        relationshipType: $rel_type
    })
    """,                   #  Cypher query
    database="neo4j",      #  Target database
    graph_name="offices",  #  Query parameter
    label="City",          #  Query parameter
    rel_type="FLY_TO"      #  Query parameter
)

assert G.node_count() == result["nodeCount"]
----

[[construct]]
== Constructing a graph from DataFrames

In addition to projecting a graph from the Neo4j database, it is also possible to create graphs directly from pandas `DataFrame` objects.

=== Syntax
.Graph construct signature
[opts="header",cols="1m,7m,1m,6", role="no-break"]
|===
| Name                            | Type                                |Default | Description
| graph_name                      | str                                 | -      | Name of the graph to be constructed.
| nodes                           | Union[DataFrame, List[DataFrame]]   | -      | One or more dataframes containing node data.
| relationships                   | Union[DataFrame, List[DataFrame]]   | -      | One or more dataframes containing relationship data.
| concurrency                     | int                                 | 4      | Number of threads used to construct the graph.
| undirected_relationship_types   | Optional[List[str]]                 | None   | List of relationship types to be projected as undirected.
|===


=== Example

[[graph-object-construct-example]]
[source,python,group=graph-roundtrip]
----
nodes = pandas.DataFrame(
    {
        "nodeId": [0, 1, 2, 3],
        "labels":  ["A", "B", "C", "A"],
        "prop1": [42, 1337, 8, 0],
        "otherProperty": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4]
    }
)

relationships = pandas.DataFrame(
    {
        "sourceNodeId": [0, 1, 2, 3],
        "targetNodeId": [1, 2, 3, 0],
        "relationshipType": ["REL", "REL", "REL", "REL"],
        "weight": [0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 42.0]
    }
)

G = gds.graph.construct(
    "my-graph",      # Graph name
    nodes,           # One or more dataframes containing node data
    relationships    # One or more dataframes containing relationship data
)

assert "REL" in G.relationship_types()
----

The above example creates a graph from two `DataFrame` objects, one for nodes and one for relationships.
The projected graph is equivalent to a graph that the following Cypher query would create in a Neo4j database:

[source,cypher]
----
CREATE
    (a:A {prop1: 42,    otherProperty: 0.1),
    (b:B {prop1: 1337,  otherProperty: 0.2),
    (c:C {prop1: 8,     otherProperty: 0.3),
    (d:A {prop1: 0,     otherProperty: 0.4),

    (a)-[:REL {weight: 0.0}]->(b),
    (b)-[:REL {weight: 0.0}]->(c),
    (c)-[:REL {weight: 0.1}]->(d),
    (d)-[:REL {weight: 42.0}]->(a),
----

The supported format for the node data frames is described in https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/graph-project-apache-arrow/#arrow-node-columns[Arrow node schema] and the format for the relationship data frames is described in https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/graph-project-apache-arrow/#arrow-relationship-columns[Arrow relationship schema].


[.enterprise-edition]
=== Apache Arrow flight server support

The `construct` method can utilize the https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/installation/installation-apache-arrow/[Apache Arrow Flight Server] of GDS if it's enabled.
This in particular means that:

* The construction of the graph is greatly sped up,
* It is possible to supply more than one data frame, both for nodes and relationships.
If multiple node dataframes are used, they need to contain distinct node ids across all node data frames.
* Prior to the `construct` call, a call to `GraphDataScience.set_database` must have been made to explicitly specify which Neo4j database should be targeted.

include::ROOT:partial$/graph-construct-limitation.adoc[]

[[networkx]]
== Loading a NetworkX graph

Another way to construct a graph from client-side data is by using the library's convenience https://networkx.org/[NetworkX] loading method.
In order to use this method, one has to install NetworkX support for the `graphdatascience` library:

[source,bash]
----
pip install graphdatascience[networkx]
----

The method that exposes the NetworkX dataset loading functionality is called `gds.graph.networkx.load`.
It returns `Graph` object, and takes three arguments:

.NetworkX graph loading method arguments
[opts="header",cols="1m,1m,3", role="no-break"]
|===
| Name        | Type           |
| nx_G        | networkx.Graph | A graph in the NetworX format
| graph_name  | str            | The name of the created GDS graph
| concurrency | int = 4        | An optional number of threads to use
|===

Exactly how the `networkx.Graph` `nx_G` maps to a GDS `Graph` projection is outlined in detail xref:graph-object.adoc#nx-schema[below].


=== Example

Let's look at an example of loading a minimal heterogeneous toy NetworkX graph.

.Example of loading a directed NetworkX graph
[source, python, networkx=true]
----
import networkx as nx

# Construct a directed NetworkX graph
nx_G = nx.DiGraph()
nx_G.add_node(1, labels=["Person"], age=52)
nx_G.add_node(42, labels=["Product", "Item"], cost=17.2)
nx_G.add_edge(1, 42, relationshipType="BUYS", quantity=4)

# Load the graph into GDS
G = gds.graph.networkx.load(nx_G, "purchases")

# Verify that the projection is what we expect
assert G.name() == "purchases"
assert G.node_count() == 2
assert set(G.node_labels()) == {"Person", "Product", "Item"}
assert G.node_properties("Person") == ["age"]
assert G.node_properties("Product") == ["cost"]
# Count rel not being = 2 indicates the graph is indeed directed
assert G.relationship_count() == 1
assert G.relationship_types() == ["BUYS"]
assert G.relationship_properties("BUYS") == ["quantity"]
----


[TIP]
====
Combined with https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/readwrite/index.html[NetworkX's functionality for reading various graph formats] one can easily load popular graph formats like edge list and GML into GDS.

[[nx-schema]]
=== NetworkX schema to GDS schema

There are some rules as to how the NetworkX graph maps to the projected `Graph` in GDS.
They follow principles similar to those of xref:graph-object#construct[], and are outlined in detail in this section.


==== Node labels

Node labels for the projected GDS graph are taken from attributes on `networkx.Graph` nodes.
The values of node attribute key `labels` will dictate what labels nodes are given in the projection.
These values should be either strings or lists of strings.

Either all nodes of the `networkx.Graph` must have valid `labels` attributes, or they can be _completely_ left out from the graph.
That is, a `networx.Graph` with no `labels` node attributes at all is also allowed.
In this latter case, the nodes in the projected `Graph` will all have the node label `N`.


==== Node properties

Node properties for the projected GDS graph are taken from attributes on `networkx.Graph` nodes.
The keys of the attributes will map to property names, and the allowed values must follow the regular guidelines for node property values in GDS.
Please note though that the node attribute key `labels` is reserved for node labels (previous section) and will not translate to node properties in the projection.


==== Relationship types

Relationship types for the projected GDS graph are taken from attributes on `networkx.Graph` edges.
The values of edge attribute key `relationshipType` will dictate what types relationships are given in the projection.
These values should be either strings or omitted.

Either all edges of the `networkx.Graph` must have valid `relationshipType` attributes, or they can be _completely_ left out from the graph.
That is, a `networx.Graph` with no `relationshipType` edge attributes at all is also allowed.
In this latter case, the relationships in the projected `Graph` will all have the relationship type `R`.


==== Relationship properties

Relationship properties for the projected GDS graph are taken from attributes on `networkx.Graph` edges.
The keys of the attributes will map to property names, and the allowed values must follow the regular guidelines for relationship property values in GDS.
Please note though that the edge attribute key `relationshipType` is reserved for relationship types (previous section) and will not translate to relationship properties in the projection.


==== Relationship direction

The direction (`DIRECTED` or `UNDIRECTED`) of the relationships in the projected GDS graph are inferred from the type of `networkx.Graph` used.
If the given NetworkX graph is directed, so a (sub)class of either `networkx.DiGraph` or `networkx.MultiDiGraph`, the relationships will be `DIRECTED` in the projection.
Otherwise, they will be `UNDIRECTED`.

include::ROOT:partial$/graph-construct-limitation.adoc[]


== Inspecting a graph object

There are convenience methods on the graph object that let us extract information about our projected graph.

.Graph object methods
[opts="header",cols="9m,6m,7m,13", role="no-break"]
|===
| Name                    | Arguments                     | Return type              | Description

| node_properties         | label: Optional[str]          | Union[Series, list[str]] | If label argument given, returns a list of the properties present on the nodes with the provided node label. Otherwise, returns a `Series` mapping every node label to a list of the properties present on nodes with that label.
| relationship_properties | type: Optional[str]           | Union[Series, list[str]] | If type argument given, returns a list of the properties present on the relationships with the provided relationship type.

|===

For example, to get the node count and node properties of a graph `G`, we would do the following:

[source,python,group=graph-project]
----
n = G.node_count()
props = G.node_properties("City")
----


== Context management

The graph object also implement the context managment protocol, i.e., is usable inside `with` clauses.
On exiting the `with` block, the graph projection will be automatically dropped on the server side.

[source,python, group=graph-project]
----
# We use the example graph from the `Projecting a graph object` section
with gds.graph.project(
    "tmp_offices",              #  Graph name
    ["City"],                   #  Node projection
    "FLY_TO",                   #  Relationship projection
    readConcurrency=4           #  Configuration parameters
)[0] as G_tmp:
    assert G_tmp.exists()

# Outside of the with block the Graph does not exist
assert not gds.graph.exists("tmp_offices")["exists"]
----


== Using a graph object

The primary use case for a graph object is to pass it to algorithms, but it's also the input to most methods of the https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/management-ops/graph-catalog-ops/[GDS Graph Catalog].


=== Input to algorithms

The Python client syntax for using a `Graph` as input to an algorithm follows the GDS Cypher procedure API, where the graph is the first parameter passed to the algorithm.

include::ROOT:partial$/algorithm-syntax.adoc[]

In this example we run the degree centrality algorithm on a graph `G`:

[[graph-object-degree-example]]
[source,python,group=graph-project]
----
result = gds.degree.mutate(G, mutateProperty="degree")
assert "centralityDistribution" in result
----


=== The graph catalog

All procedures of the https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/management-ops/graph-catalog-ops/[GDS Graph Catalog] have corresponding Python methods in the client.
Of those catalog procedures that take a graph name string as input, their Python client equivalents instead take a `Graph` object, with the exception of `gds.graph.exists` which still takes a graph name string.

Below are some examples of how the GDS Graph Catalog can be used via the client, assuming we inspect the graph `G` from the <<graph-object-degree-example, example above>>:

[source,python,group=graph-project]
----
# List graphs in the catalog
list_result = gds.graph.list()

# Check for existence of a graph in the catalog
exists_result = gds.graph.exists("offices")
assert exists_result["exists"]

# Stream the node property 'degree'
result = gds.graph.nodeProperty.stream(G, node_property="degree")

# Drop a graph; same as G.drop()
gds.graph.drop(G)
----


[[graph-object-streaming-properties]]
==== Streaming properties

The client methods

* https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/management-ops/graph-reads/graph-stream-nodes/[`gds.graph.nodeProperty.stream`] (previously `gds.graph.streamNodeProperty`)
* https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/management-ops/graph-reads/graph-stream-nodes/[`gds.graph.nodeProperties.stream`] (previously `gds.graph.streamNodeProperties`)
* https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/management-ops/graph-reads/graph-stream-relationships/[`gds.graph.relationshipProperty.stream`] (previously `gds.graph.streamRelationshipProperty`)
* https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/management-ops/graph-reads/graph-stream-relationships/[`gds.graph.relationshipProperties.stream`] (previously `gds.graph.streamRelationshipProperties`)

are greatly sped up if https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/installation/installation-apache-arrow/[Apache Arrow Flight Server] of GDS is enabled.

Additionally, setting the client only optional keyword parameter `separate_property_columns=True` (it defaults to `False`) for `gds.graph.streamNodeProperties` and `gds.graph.streamRelationshipProperties` returns a pandas `DataFrame` in which each property requested has its own column.
Note that this is different from the default behavior for which there would only be one column called `propertyValue` that contains all properties requested interleaved for each node or relationship.


[[graph-object-streaming-db-properties]]
==== Including node properties from Neo4j

Node properties such as names and descriptions are useful to understand the output of an algorithm, even if not needed to run the algorithm itself.
To fetch additional node properties directly from the Neo4j database, you can use the `db_node_properties` client-only parameter of the `gds.graph.nodeProperty.stream` and `gds.graph.nodeProperties.stream` methods.

In the following example, the `City` nodes have both a numeric and a `String` property.
The `stream` method retrieves the values of the database-only `name` property alongside the values of the projected `population` property.

[source,python,group=graph-project]
----
gds.run_cypher(
  """
  CREATE
    (m: City {name: "Malmö", population: 360000}),
    (l: City {name: "London", population: 8800000}),
    (s: City {name: "San Mateo", population: 105000}),

    (m)-[:FLY_TO]->(l),
    (l)-[:FLY_TO]->(m),
    (l)-[:FLY_TO]->(s),
    (s)-[:FLY_TO]->(l)
  """
)

G, result = gds.graph.project(
    "offices",
    {
        "City": {
            "properties": ["population"]
        }
    },
    "FLY_TO"
)

gds.graph.nodeProperties.stream(G, node_properties=["population"], db_node_properties=["name"])
----


==== Streaming topology by relationship type

The type returned from the Python client method corresponding to https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/graph-catalog-relationship-ops/#_stream[`gds.beta.graph.relationships.stream`] is called `TopologyDataFrame` and inherits from the standard pandas `DataFrame`.
`TopologyDataFrame` comes with an additional convenience method named `by_rel_type` which takes no arguments, and returns a dictionary of the form `Dict[str, List[List[int]]]`.
This dictionary maps relationship types as strings to `2 x m` matrices where `m` here represents the number of relationhips of the given type.
The first row of each such matrix are the source node ids of the relationships, and the second row are the corresponding target node ids.

We can illustrate this transformation with an example using our graph `G` from the <<graph-object-construct-example, contruct example above>>:

[source,python, group=graph-roundtrip, min-server-version=2.2.0]
----
topology_by_rel_type = gds.beta.graph.relationships.stream(G).by_rel_type()

assert list(topology_by_rel_type.keys()) == ["REL"]
assert topology_by_rel_type["REL"][0] == [0, 1, 2, 3]
assert topology_by_rel_type["REL"][1] == [1, 2, 3, 0]
----

Like the <<graph-object-streaming-properties>> methods, the `gds.beta.graph.relationships.stream` is also accelerated if the GDS Apache Arrow Flight Server is enabled.
