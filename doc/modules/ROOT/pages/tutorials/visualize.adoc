https://colab.research.google.com/github/neo4j/graph-data-science-client/blob/main/examples/import-sample-export-gnn.ipynb[image:https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg[Open

This Jupyter notebook is hosted
https://github.com/neo4j/graph-data-science-client/blob/main/examples/visualize-with-pyvis.ipynb[here]
in the Neo4j Graph Data Science Client Github repository.

The notebook exemplifies how to visualize a graph projection in the GDS
Graph Catalog using the `graphdatascience`
(https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science-client/current/[docs]) and
`pyvis` (https://pyvis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html[docs])
libraries.

== Prerequisites

Running this notebook requires a Neo4j server with GDS installed. We
recommend using Neo4j Desktop with GDS, or AuraDS.

Also required are of course the Python libraries `graphdatascience` and
`pyvis`:

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
%pip install graphdatascience pyvis
----

== Setup

We start by importing our dependencies and setting up our GDS client
connection to the database.

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
from graphdatascience import GraphDataScience
import os
from pyvis.network import Network
----

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
# Get Neo4j DB URI, credentials and name from environment if applicable
NEO4J_URI = os.environ.get("NEO4J_URI", "bolt://localhost:7687")
NEO4J_AUTH = None
NEO4J_DB = os.environ.get("NEO4J_DB", "neo4j")
if os.environ.get("NEO4J_USER") and os.environ.get("NEO4J_PASSWORD"):
    NEO4J_AUTH = (
        os.environ.get("NEO4J_USER"),
        os.environ.get("NEO4J_PASSWORD"),
    )
gds = GraphDataScience(NEO4J_URI, auth=NEO4J_AUTH, database=NEO4J_DB)
----

== Sampling Cora

Next we use the
https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science-client/current/common-datasets/#_cora[built-in
Cora loader] to get the data into GDS. The nodes in the Cora dataset is
represented by academic papers, and the relationships connecting them
are citations.

We will then sample a smaller representative subgraph from it that is
more suitable for visualization.

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
G = gds.graph.load_cora()
----

Let’s make sure we constructed the correct graph.

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
print(f"Metadata for our loaded Cora graph `G`: {G}")
print(f"Node labels present in `G`: {G.node_labels()}")
----


Metadata for our loaded Cora graph `G`: Graph(name=cora, node_count=2708, relationship_count=5429)
Node labels present in `G`: ['Paper']

It’s looks correct! Now let’s go ahead and sample the graph.

We use the random walk with restarts sampling algorithm to get a smaller
graph that structurally represents the full graph. In this example we
will use the algorithm’s default parameters, but check out
https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/management-ops/graph-creation/sampling/rwr/[the
algorithm’s docs] to see how you can for example specify the size of the
subgraph, and choose which start node around which the subgraph will be
sampled.

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
G_sample, _ = gds.graph.sample.rwr("cora_sample", G, randomSeed=42, concurrency=1)
----

We should have somewhere around 0.15 * 2708 ~ 406 nodes in our sample.
And let’s see how many relationships we got.

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
print(f"Number of nodes in our sample: {G_sample.node_count()}")
print(f"Number of relationships in our sample: {G_sample.relationship_count()}")
----


Number of nodes in our sample: 406
Number of relationships in our sample: 532

Let’s also compute
https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/algorithms/page-rank/[PageRank]
on our sample graph, in order to get an importance score that we call
``rank'' for each node. It will be interesting for context when we
visualize the graph.

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
gds.pageRank.mutate(G_sample, mutateProperty="rank")
----

----

== Exporting the sampled Cora graph

We can now export the topology and node properties of our sampled graph
that we want to visualize.

Let’s start by fetching the relationships.

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
sample_topology_df = gds.graph.relationships.stream(G_sample)
display(sample_topology_df)
----

[cols=",,,",options="header",]

532 rows × 3 columns

We get the right amount of rows, one for each expected relationship. So
that looks good.

Next we should fetch the node properties we are interested in. Each node
will have a ``subject'' property which will be an integer 0,…,6 that
indicates which of seven academic subjects the paper represented by the
nodes belong to. We will also fetch the PageRank property ``rank'' that
we computed above.

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
sample_node_properties_df = gds.graph.nodeProperties.stream(
    G_sample,
    ["subject", "rank"],
    separate_property_columns=True,
)
display(sample_node_properties_df)
----

|405 |1154276 |0.277500 |0.0
|===

406 rows × 3 columns

Now that we have all the data we want to visualize, we can create a
network with PyVis. We color each node according to its ``subject'', and
size it according to its ``rank''.

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
net = Network(notebook = True,
cdn_resources="remote",
                bgcolor = "#222222",
                font_color = "white",
                height = "750px", # Modify according to your screen size
                width = "100%",
)

# Seven suitable light colors, one for each "subject"
subject_to_color = ["#80cce9", "#fbd266", "#a9eebc", "#e53145", "#d2a6e2", "#f3f3f3", "#ff91af"]

# Add all the nodes
for _, node in sample_node_properties_df.iterrows():
    net.add_node(int(node["nodeId"]), color=subject_to_color[int(node["subject"])], value=node["rank"])

# Add all the relationships
net.add_edges(zip(sample_topology_df["sourceNodeId"], sample_topology_df["targetNodeId"]))

net.show("cora-sample.html")
----


ifdef::backend-html5[]

include::ROOT:partial$/cora-sample.html[]

endif::[]


Unsurprisingly we can see that papers largely seem clustered by academic
subject. We also note that some nodes appear larger in size, indicating
that they have a higher centrality score according to PageRank.

We can scroll over the graphic to zoom in/out, and ``click and drag''
the background to navigate to different parts of the network. If we
click on a node, it will be highlighted along with the relationships
connected to it. And if we ``click and drag'' a node, we can move it.

Additionally one could enable more sophisticated navigational features
for searching and filtering by providing `select_menu = True` and
`filter_menu = True` respectively to the PyVis `Network` constructor
above. Check out the
https://pyvis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html[PyVis documentation]
for this.

== Cleanup

We remove the Cora graphs from the GDS graph catalog to free up memory.

[source, python, role=no-test]

_ = G_sample.drop()
_ = G.drop()
