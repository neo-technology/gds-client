# Examples

This folder contains example notebooks on how to use the `graphdatascience` python client.


## Custom tooling for notebooks

As for the rest of this repository, you can run `../scripts/makestyle` and `../scripts/checkstyle` to apply and check the style of the notebook.
By default, `makestyle` will remove all cell outputs. If you want to preserve some outputs, tag the cell with `preserve-output`.

To generate documenatation, you can run `../scripts/nb2doc/convert`.

If you only want to let CI run the notebook given a certain condition, tag a given cell in the notebook with `verify-version`.
As the name suggests, the tag was introduced to only run for given GDS server versions.
To make sure certain cells are run even in case of failure, tag the cell with `teardown`.
